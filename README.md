DJ CORP (A DJ booking website)
The Dj corp site is designed to be minamlist and ery user friendly with everything directing the user back to the contact page to get in touch about what is on offer and pricing for personal needs.

UX
This site is for people looking for a DJ for a number of different reasons. What users should be able to achieve by visiting this site is seeing what services the company offers and reasurrance from previous customers about how the DJs preformed.
I think my site is the best way for people to achieve what they are looking for becuase its clean easily navigatable and provides enough information that people should be compelled to ask for pricing.

Bride to Be - Needs an after band DJ hears from a friend about this company called DJ corp. Google searches the name and gets presented with this site. On the landing page see the picture of the couple kissing scrolls over it and sees that it is a link and then the word weedings come down. Before clicking it she reades the first quote under the picture. After clicing on the picture she gets brought to a page with what the company offers for weddings, she gets enough ideas from the list that she wants to contact the company directly. She goes to the contact page and fills in the form along with the comment section asking for specfics.

Customer Feedback - This should give reasurrance to new clients who visit the page.
Contact Page - This will let the client reach out to the company to find out more and book a DJ for their event
Landing Page - Each Picture is a link with a clear visual representation of what the kind of events the compnay cater for.
Each Section (weddings birthdays, Venues and Fashion shows) - should provide a short written description of what the company offers

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
