DJ CORP (A DJ booking website)

The Dj corp site is designed to be minamlist and ery user friendly with everything directing the user back to the contact page to get in touch about what is on offer and pricing for personal needs.

UX

This site is for people looking for a DJ for a number of different reasons. What users should be able to achieve by visiting this site is seeing what services the company offers and reasurrance from previous customers about how the DJs preformed.
I think my site is the best way for people to achieve what they are looking for becuase its clean, easily navigatable and provides enough information that people should be compelled to ask for pricing. I choose the color screen of white, grey, pink and orange as the pink and orange pops from the screen in contrast to the grey and white drawing the eye to the text.

Testing

UX on mobile - while creating the website I constantly checked each change by using the inspect element of the web browser and selcting a mobile type. This often brought to light simple changes needed to be made for mobile users so that the information was more appealing on a mobile device. e.g removing the profile pictures from the quotes on the landing page. Whle testing I found that I had to edit the image I used for the quote section as the white writing got lost in the image. 

Landing page 

On desktop, when hovering over the pictures on the landing page I found the writing drop down was too slow for users to see in time and then changed the timing from 1sec to 0.5 sec.

Contact form 

Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

Peronal testing

Asked friends to go through the website and see how they feel it works. Users indicated that the writing on the landing page was difficult to read with the background image and this prompted the edit of it.

Deployment

Commiting every few lines of code. Pushing the code to Github at the end of each writing session. 
Currently the deployed version is the finsihed verion.
