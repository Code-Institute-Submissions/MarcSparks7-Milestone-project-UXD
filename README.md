# DJ CORP (A DJ booking website) 

*The Dj corp site is designed to be minimalist and very user friendly with everything directing the user back to the contact page to get in touch about what is on offer and pricing for personal needs.*

## UX

This site is for people looking for a DJ for a number of different reasons. What users should be able to achieve by visiting this site is seeing what services the company offers and reassurance from previous customers about how the DJs performed.

I think my site is the best way for people to achieve what they are looking for because it is clean, easily navigatable and provides enough information that people should be compelled to ask for pricing. I chose the colour screen of white, grey, pink and orange as the pink and orange pops from the screen in contrast to the grey and white drawing the eye to the text.

## Additional Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### UX on mobile 
- Simple changes were needed to be made for mobile users so that the information was more appealing on a mobile device. e.g removing the profile pictures from the quotes on the landing page. While testing I found that I had to edit the image I used for the quote section as the white writing got lost in the image. 

### Landing page 

- On a desktop, when hovering over the pictures on the landing page I found the writing dropdown was too slow for users to see in time and then changed the timing from 1sec to 0.5 sec.

### Contact form 

- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.

## Deployment

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. The page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
